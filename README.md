# Gumbo Racing Shop

This is gonna be a lil shop mimicking the one that I already have set up on shopify.

Day 1 I planned out the first bit of what I needed which was an outline for the database and a little bit of backend info needed to setup the website.

Day 2 I'm filling out the whole database with User, Product, and Shopping Cart information for when someone wants to buy something.

Day 3 tested the database and seeded it, now working on my routes and making sure they go to the right places. (also set the icon for the website in my html head)
